    narration:
      "Once upon a time, in a stone-built city beneath a sleeping mountain, a young clerk of the merchant's guild grew tired of selling things and resolved instead to make them. He apprenticed himself to the code-wrights of BlueNet, and his first great labor was an enchanted ledger for the Inn of a Hundred Keys — a book that knew every guest, every room, and every candle lit therein. And the innkeepers marveled, for nothing was ever lost again.",

    narration:
      "Word of the apprentice's craft crossed the mountains to the alpine city of Zürich, where the Guild of the Bee kept a thousand couriers aloft. 'Build us a looking-glass,' said the beekeepers, 'that we may see every wing at once.' So he built it from nothing at all — his first work made to be carried in a pocket — and from that day no parcel, however small, ever wandered from its path.",

    narration:
      "In the grey citadel of Berlin stood a rookery of unusual size. Four billion ravens passed through its towers, each bearing a message, and fifty thousand merchant houses trusted them with their words. The hero — for so we may now call him — was set over the great dispatch boards, and he wrought them so well that the sky itself seemed orderly.",

    narration:
      "Then came a summons from the golden dunes, where a great bank kept a dragon of renown coiled about its treasure. None doubted the beast's strength; the trouble was teaching it manners. The hero built passages of glass through which the people could reach their gold — safely, swiftly, and without waking so much as one scale — and he even taught the dragon to lease out carriages.",

      "Homeward then, to the rose-stone city, where a bazaar of a thousand stalls was to be raised. The hero did not build the stalls. He did something cleverer: he carved master patterns from which any stall could be raised in a day, true and identical, by any pair of willing hands. Masons came from far away just to study the stones.",

      "And so at last the road bent north, to a kingdom of pine and long light, where a new treasury was rising — AMIO by name — with walls of glass, so the people might always see their gold. There the hero works to this day: raising vaults, drawing plans with the founders themselves, and teaching young apprentices the old craft. Whether he lives happily ever after is not yet written — the best chronicles never quite end.",
